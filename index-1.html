<p><img alt="Welcome to OpenComputers" src="assets/misc/banner.png" /></p>
<p>OpenComputers is a Minecraft mod that adds programmable computers and robots to the game. The built-in computer implementation uses Lua 5.2 and is fully persistent. This means programs will continue running across reloads. For more information, please <a href="http://ocdoc.cil.li/">see the wiki</a>. Feel invited to visit the <a href="http://oc.cil.li/">community forums</a> or drop by in the <a href="http://webchat.esper.net/?channels=#oc">IRC channel #oc on esper.net</a>.</p>

<h3 id="experimental-builds">Experimental Builds</h3>
<p>You can find experimental builds <a href="http://ci.cil.li/">on the build server</a>. Expect these to be generally more unstable than builds marked as releases. Use these <strong>at your own risk</strong>, but - when using the latest one - please <em>do</em> report bugs you encounter using them. Thanks!</p>
<h2 id="license-use-in-modpacks">License / Use in Modpacks</h2>
<p>This mod is <a href="https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/blob/master-MC1.7.10/LICENSE">licensed under the <strong>MIT license</strong></a>. All <strong>assets are public domain</strong>, unless otherwise stated; all are free to be distributed as long as the license / source credits are kept. This means you can use this mod in any mod pack <strong>as you please</strong>. I'd be happy to hear about you using it, though, just out of curiosity.</p>
<h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>
<h3 id="assets-and-localizations">Assets and Localizations</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Translations</strong><br />
   Translations to other languages are very much appreciated. You can find the localization files <a href="https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/tree/master-MC1.7.10/src/main/resources/assets/opencomputers/lang">in this folder</a>. If a localization you wanted to create already exists, please take the time to see if the present one is complete - the strings change every so often, invalidating some of the translations. If you start a fresh localization, please base it off of the English or German one, those are the 'master' localization files. If you add a new language, please also add it to <a href="https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/blob/master-MC1.7.10/src/main/resources/pack.mcmeta">the pack.mcmeta</a> file. Keep it sorted alphabetically, use the name and region Minecraft itself uses. If you don't know how to do that, that's OK, I'll do it later.</li>
<li><strong>Textures</strong><br />
   If you would like to contribute better textures for certain items or blocks, feel free to pull-request them. If you would like to contribute <em>alternative</em> textures, make it a resource pack, and post it on the forums, for example.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong><br />
   Help with keeping the <a href="http://ocdoc.cil.li/">wiki</a> up to date would be <em>really</em> appreciated. If you notice anything amiss and know better, fix it. If you don't ask someone who does, then fix it. If you had a question answered, consider adding that information somewhere in the wiki where you would have expected to find that information.<br />
   There are also the files containing the ingame help <a href="https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/tree/master-MC1.7.10/src/main/resources/assets/opencomputers/loot/OpenOS/usr/man">for programs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/tree/master-MC1.7.10/src/main/resources/assets/opencomputers/doc">for blocks and items</a>, which could probably be much better than they are right now. Improvements to them, and new ones (e.g. for the libraries, such as <code>text</code> or <code>sides</code>) would help a lot. Thanks!</li>
<li><strong>Robot Names</strong><br />
   Robots get a random name when placed (unless set with an Anvil). The list the names are chose from <a href="https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/blob/master-MC1.7.10/src/main/resources/assets/opencomputers/robot.names">can be found here</a>. Feel free to pull request additional names! <em>However</em>: since the list has grown to a considerable length already, here are the two basic criteria for new names: it must either be a real or fictional robot, or an AI that at least <em>appears</em> to be self-aware.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="bug-fixes-features-and-scripts">Bug fixes, features and scripts</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bugs</strong><br />
   If you've found a bug, please report it in the <a href="https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/issues?state=open">issue tracker</a>, after checking it has not been reported before - and possibly even fixed by now. If you think you can and have fixed it, feel free to do a pull request, I'll happily pull it if it looks all right to me - otherwise I'll gladly tell you what to change to get it merged.</li>
<li><strong>Features</strong><br />
   If you'd like to propose a new feature, take it to the <a href="http://oc.cil.li/">forums</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/issues?state=open">issue tracker</a>. If you'd like to contribute code that adds new features, please make sure to discuss the feature with me, first - again, the issue tracker is an OK place for this, there are a couple of feature requests there, already. Alternatively start a topic on the forums to discuss the feature, and / or stop by the <a href="http://webchat.esper.net/?channels=#oc">IRC</a> to talk about it. Blind / unexpected feature pull requests might very well not make it, so save yourself some time by talking about it, first! Thanks.</li>
<li><strong>Scripts / Programs</strong><br />
   OpenComputers generates floppy disks in dungeon chests that can contain data from a selection of 'loot' directories. For example, the IRC client and the Better Shell (besh) are two programs that can be found on such loot disks. If you'd like to contribute a program that can be found this way, please have a look at <a href="https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/tree/master-MC1.7.10/src/main/resources/assets/opencomputers/loot">the loot readme</a>, which explains how to add custom loot. Simply pull request your loot!</li>
<li><strong>Core Scripts</strong><br />
   If you would like to contribute scripts to the "core" Lua code (which basically defines 'OpenOS'), please have a look at the <a href="http://ocdoc.cil.li/lua_conventions">code conventions</a> for Lua to save us all some time. Bug fixes are always welcome. Additional programs and features should be kept small. Bigger programs (rule of thumb: larger than 3KiB) should go onto loot disks.</li>
<li><strong>Drivers</strong><br />
   As of OC 1.4, mod interaction that was previously provided by OpenComponents it now fully integrated into OC itself. If you wish to contribute a driver for blocks from other mods, cool! Have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/tree/master-MC1.7.10/src/main/scala/li/cil/oc/integration">integration</a> package to get an idea of how to structure modules and read the readme in that package for more information (in particular on additional criteria to get your PR merged).</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="pull-requests">Pull requests</h4>
<p>The following are a few quick guidelines on pull requests. That is to say they are not necessarily <em>rules</em>, so there may be exceptions and all that. Just try to stick to those points as a baseline.
- Make sure your code is formatted properly.
- Make sure it builds and works.
- Try to keep your changes as minimal as possible. In particular, no whitespace changes in existing files, please.
- Feel free to code in Java, but don't be surprised if I convert it to Scala later on, if I feel it makes the code more concise ;-)
- When adding mod dependencies, keep them <em>weak</em>, i.e. make sure OC still works without that mod. Also, prefer adding a Gradle dependency over adding API class files to the repo.
- <a href="http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html">Squash</a> your commits!</p>
<p>Also, and this should go without saying, your contributed code will also fall under OC's license, unless otherwise specified (in the super rare case of adding third-party stuff, add the according license information as a <code>LICENSE-???</code> file, please).</p>
<h2 id="extending">Extending</h2>
<h3 id="in-your-own-mod">In your own mod</h3>
<p>To use <a href="https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/tree/master-MC1.7.10/src/main/java/li/cil/oc/api">the API</a> in your own mod, either get the API JAR from the <a href="http://ci.cil.li/">build server</a>, or if you're using <a href="http://gradle.org/">Gradle</a>, add a dependency to the maven repo:
<code>groovy
repositories {
    maven { url = "http://maven.cil.li/" }
}
dependencies {
    compile "li.cil.oc:OpenComputers:MC1.7.10-1.5.+:api"
}</code>
Adjust the version number accordingly to the version you'd like to build against.</p>
<p>To run the mod in your development environment, download the <a href="http://oc.cil.li/index.php?/page/latest.php?repo=OpenComputers-dev-MC1.7.10&amp;type=dev"><code>dev</code> JAR from the build server</a> and drop it into your development environment's <code>eclipse/mods</code> (Eclipse) or <code>run/mods</code> (IntelliJ IDEA) folder.</p>
<p>Alternatively, leave out the <code>api</code> classifier and you can build against the dev JAR directly. This way you don't have to add it to your mods folder, but you will have to add <code>-Dfml.coreMods.load=li.cil.oc.common.launch.TransformerLoader</code> to the VM options in your run configuration.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask, either in the <a href="http://oc.cil.li/">forums</a> or in the <a href="http://webchat.esper.net/?channels=#oc">IRC</a>!</p>
<h3 id="opencomputers">OpenComputers</h3>
<p>Want to tinker with the mod itself? Here is how - for IntelliJ IDEA users.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>
- Make sure you have the Gradle plugin enabled in IntelliJ IDEA (File-&gt;Settings-&gt;Plugins).
- Make sure you have the Scala plugin enabled.</p>
<p>Clone the repository, then in it run<br />
<code>gradlew setupDecompWorkspace</code><br />
to setup the workspace, including assets and such, then<br />
<code>gradlew idea</code><br />
to create an IntelliJ IDEA project.</p>
<p>Open the project and you will be asked to <em>import the Gradle project</em> (check your Event Log if you missed the pop-up). <strong>Do so</strong>. This will configure additionally referenced libraries.</p>
<p>For more specific instructions, read <a href="http://ocdoc.cil.li/tutorial:debug_1.7.10">Steps to run master MC1.7.10 from IDEA</a></p>
<p>In the case you wish to use Eclipse rather than IntelliJ IDEA, the process is mostly the same, except you must run <code>gradlew eclipse</code> rather than <code>gradlew idea</code>.</p>
