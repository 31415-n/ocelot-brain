## ocelot-brain

The core of Ocelot project.  
This is a library that contains the internal code of OpenComputers mod
separated from it's Minecraft origins. 

This means that you can use it to build your own OpenComputers emulator
for any platform (Linux, Windows, Mac OS and BSD - using JNLua, or any other
platform that supports Java - using LuaJ fallback).  
For example the Ocelot.Online project uses Ocelot-Brain to do all the
emulation on backend.

This repository contains some examples of the library usage in the
`totoro.ocelot.demo` package.

**P.S.** The project is a work-in-progress, so breaking changes and bugs will break
all the things from time to time. Beware.
